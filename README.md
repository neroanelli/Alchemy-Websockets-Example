Alchemy Websockets Example
=============
A simple chat server built using [Alchemy Websockets](https://github.com/Olivine-Labs/Alchemy-Websockets) 
and [Alchemy Websockets Client Library](https://github.com/Olivine-Labs/Alchemy-Websockets-Client-Library).

Install or build and run the server source and run the chat.html file. Note:
flash websockets doesn't appear to work locally; test it in a websocket-enabled
browser or host a server elsewhere and connect to it over IP / username.

You can connect to server.alchemywebsockets.net for a test server as well.

Feel free to try out the online example at [chat.alchemywebsockets.net](http://chat.alchemywebsockets.net)

Usage
-------
Enter in a server name and port (or used the pre-filled defaults.) Click
connect, then enter a username and register. You can now chat with anyone
online. Connects and disconnects are announced, as is the total number of
online people (hover over the number to see how many.)

You can also type "/nick Name" to change your current name to "Name".
